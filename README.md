# 🔗 URL Shortener API

A simple and efficient backend service that shortens long URLs and redirects users using unique short codes.

Built as a backend-focused project to demonstrate core concepts in API design, database integration, and routing.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generate short URLs from long links
- Redirect users using short codes
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- RESTful API built with Express
- Simple and clean architecture

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **pg (node-postgres)**

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener
```

---

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdb
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

### 4. Run the server

```bash
node app.js
```

Server will start on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 🔹 Create Short URL

**POST** `/shorten`

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "customCode": "my-custom-alias"
}
```

`customCode` is optional. If provided, the app stores a custom alias instead of generating a random short code.

#### Response:

```json
{
  "shortUrl": "http://localhost:3000/abc123",
  "qrCode": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "original_url": "https://example.com",
    "short_code": "abc123",
    "user_id": 1,
    "created_at": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Generate QR Code for a Short Link

**GET** `/qr/:shortCode`

Example:

```
GET /qr/abc123
```

This returns a PNG image of a QR code that points to the short URL.

---

### 🔹 Redirect to Original URL

**GET** `/:shortCode`

Example:

```
http://localhost:3000/abc123
```

➡️ Redirects to:

```
https://example.com
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Table: `links`

| Column       | Type      | Description             |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------- |
| id           | SERIAL    | Primary key             |
| original_url | TEXT      | The original long URL   |
| short_code   | TEXT      | Unique short identifier |
| created_at   | TIMESTAMP | Time of creation        |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A user submits a long URL via the `/shorten` endpoint
2. The server generates a unique short code
3. The URL and code are stored in PostgreSQL
4. When the short URL is accessed:
   - The server looks up the original URL
   - Redirects the user to the destination

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 📊 Click tracking (analytics)
- 🔗 Custom short URLs (aliases)
- ⏱ Expiration dates for links
- ⚡ Caching with Redis
- 🔐 Rate limiting & security enhancements
- 🌍 Deployment with custom domain

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

```bash
POST /shorten
→ returns http://localhost:3000/xyz789

GET /xyz789
→ redirects to original URL
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running before starting the app
- Do not commit your `.env` file (it contains sensitive data)
- Always normalize URLs (include `http://` or `https://`)
